// Single source of truth for the admin API's wire shapes now lives in packages/contracts,
// shared with apps/api's own Zod-validated routes (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §8/§20 Phase 6) —
// this file is a thin re-export barrel so the ~20 files across this app that already
// `import type {...} from '@/lib/types'` don't need touching individually.
//
// The const-array value import below deliberately reaches past @kenresoft-cms/contracts' own
// barrel (api/index.ts) straight to schemas/enums.ts. Confirmed empirically: importing
// FIELD_TYPES etc. via the barrel — even after splitting enums into their own zod-free file —
// still pulled zod into this app's production bundle, because Rollup didn't fully separate
// individual bindings through the barrel's chain of `export *` re-exports spanning several
// zod-schema-bearing files. A direct path to the one file that never imports zod at all
// sidesteps that entirely — confirmed by grepping the built bundle for ZodError/ZodObject/
// ZodType before and after (present via the barrel, absent via this direct path).
