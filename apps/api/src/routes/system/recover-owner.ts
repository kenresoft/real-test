// Unauthenticated by design — this is deployment-wide, not per-account, so it carries none of
// the account-enumeration risk that keeps /public/password-reset/request's response generic
// regardless of input. Lets ForgotPasswordPage/RecoverWithCodePage/LoginPage's verification
// UI tell someone up front that password-reset and account-verification email can't actually
// be delivered on this deployment, rather than them waiting on an email that was never going
// to arrive. docs/DEPLOYMENT.md's recovery section has the setup steps for enabling real
// delivery.
//
// Checks the full required config per provider, not just EMAIL_PROVIDER's own value — setting
// EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend with no RESEND_API_KEY/EMAIL_FROM (or =cloudflare with no EMAIL
// binding/EMAIL_FROM) would previously have reported "configured" even though
// resend.ts/cloudflare.ts already throw at actual send time. Still purely static, no network
// call — this is not a live delivery test.
//
// authSecretConfigured lets an operator (or the setup/update CLI) check whether
// BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is real without needing `wrangler secret list` CLI access at all — a real
// deployment was found running on better-auth's own known-default secret with nothing in the
// normal request flow surfacing it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Changelog has the incident).
// createAuth() itself now refuses to start at all in that state (apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts), so
// this field will only ever read `false` for a request that never reaches an authed route in
// the first place — still worth exposing here since this endpoint is unauthenticated and cheap
// to check proactively, before anything else 500s.
