// better-auth is pinned to an exact version (not ^) because @better-auth/cli's schema
// generator bundles its own internal better-auth copy rather than using the app's — as of
// 2026-08-26 the CLI's published "latest" is stuck on the 1.4.x line while the main package
// is on 1.7.x, and generating against a newer runtime produced schema missing fields the
// 1.7.x runtime expects (e.g. "issuer" on the account table), which fails at request time,
// not at generate time. Pinning both to the exact version @better-auth/cli generates against
// keeps schema and runtime verified-consistent. Re-check this pin before bumping either
// package — see apps/api/package.json.

// A plain custom field is enough for the role model this CMS actually needs — the full `admin`
// plugin (impersonation, banning, org-level ac statements) is more surface area than the
// owner/admin/editor/author/viewer hierarchy requires, and its own role/ban concepts would
// duplicate rather than replace what's built here (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §10).

      // the remote API (docs in README.md's "Live deployment" section) — genuinely
      // cross-site, not just cross-port, from the browser's perspective. A Lax cookie is
      // still *set* by a cross-site response, but never *sent back* on the next cross-site
      // request, so the very next session check silently fails — the sign-in POST succeeds
      // (a real account gets created/authenticated server-side) while the browser never
      // becomes visibly signed in. `None` requires `Secure` — not just "every real deployment
      // already uses HTTPS", but a hard requirement of the SameSite=None cookie spec itself: a
      // browser drops the cookie outright if Secure isn't literally present in the header,
      // regardless of the connection's actual scheme. better-auth only sets Secure
      // automatically when it infers HTTPS from BETTER_AUTH_URL/the request, which is false
      // for local dev's plain-http Worker — silently breaking sign-in there (caught by the
      // apps/admin Playwright E2E suite: the sign-up API call succeeded and returned a
      // Set-Cookie header, but Chromium never sent it back on the next request, because that
      // header had SameSite=None with no Secure). Forcing secure:true unconditionally is safe
