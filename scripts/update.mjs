// Redeploys an *existing* Kenresoft CMS install after pulling in new CMS code — the safe subset
// of scripts/setup.mjs's first-install flow, deliberately leaving out everything that provisions
// new resources or touches secrets/config a running deployment already depends on:
//   - Does NOT create or re-provision D1/R2 (ensureD1/ensureR2 in setup.mjs are also skip-if-
//     present, so re-running full setup wouldn't have duplicated them either — but this script
//     never even calls them, since an update has nothing to provision in the first place).
//   - Does NOT touch BETTER_AUTH_SECRET at all. Applies even after setup.mjs's own fix to check
//     before overwriting it: an update should never even ask.
//   - Does NOT touch CORS_ORIGINS — the admin Worker's URL never changes between deploys of the
//     same Worker, so there's never a new origin to add on an update.
//   - Does NOT re-run the interactive email setup prompt.
// What it does do (bare `pnpm run update`, no flags): pull new code from the "upstream" git
// remote (see lib/git-cli.mjs), install dependencies, apply any new migrations (Drizzle only
// applies ones not yet recorded remotely — safe to run every time), and redeploy both Workers
// with the current code. This is the command an existing deployment should run instead of
// `pnpm run setup` to pick up new CMS changes, precisely because setup.mjs's ensureAuthSecret()
// used to (and other steps still do) prompt/act as if this were a first-ever install.
//
// Targeted reconfiguration: `pnpm run update -- --auth` / `--email` / `--storage` / `--database` /
// `--domain` modifies exactly that one configuration category (scripts/lib/configure.mjs) and
// does NOT pull code, install deps, or touch any other category — the two concerns (picking up
// new CMS code vs. changing this deployment's own configuration) are deliberately kept separate,
// per this project's non-negotiable rule that a value only ever changes when explicitly
// requested. Add `--ci` for non-interactive use (reads `*_NEW` environment variables instead of
// prompting; an omitted variable always means "leave unchanged" — see configure.mjs). `--domain`
// connects a custom domain to the API Worker via `[[routes]]`/`custom_domain = true` (Cloudflare
// creates the DNS record and route automatically on deploy — no dashboard step needed) and, only
// if explicitly confirmed afterward, disables the *.workers.dev fallback URL — run `--auth` right
// after to point BETTER_AUTH_URL at the new domain and rebuild the admin app against it.
// `--admin-domain` does the same for the Admin Worker's own, separate wrangler.toml, and also
// refreshes the ADMIN_URL secret (used to build password-reset/verification email links) to match
// — nothing else does that automatically.
//
// Which branch to pull: bare `pnpm run update` follows upstream's actual default branch,
// auto-detected every run (see lib/git-cli.mjs) — correct for a real install, which should
// always track whatever the project currently ships as stable. A deployment deliberately used
// for *testing* pre-release code (e.g. a staging install that wants to try `develop` before it
// reaches `main`) can override this per run with `--branch <name>`, or set it once via the
// `UPDATE_BRANCH` environment variable so every future `pnpm run update` in that checkout keeps
// using it without repeating the flag — an explicit `--branch` always wins over `UPDATE_BRANCH`
// if both are given.
//
// Usage:
//   pnpm run update
//   pnpm run update -- --auth [--ci]
//   pnpm run update -- --email [--ci]
//   pnpm run update -- --storage
//   pnpm run update -- --database
//   pnpm run update -- --domain [--ci]
//   pnpm run update -- --admin-domain [--ci]
//   pnpm run update -- --branch develop     # or: UPDATE_BRANCH=develop pnpm run update
