# Astro Integration

**Status: Phase 1 (local integration) complete, 2026-08-27. Phase 2 (production deployment)
not started.** See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §15 for how this fits the broader architecture, and
§20 (Implementation Roadmap) for where it sits in the project's phases.

## What Kenresoft CMS is

Kenresoft CMS is a **frontend-agnostic, API-first** content management platform. The CMS
(Worker + D1 + R2, `apps/api`) and its admin UI (`apps/admin`) are one deployable unit; anyone
consuming its content — a website, a mobile app, another service — talks to it exclusively
through the **public REST API** (`GET /api/v1/public/...`, unauthenticated, read-only,
published content only). Nothing about the CMS core assumes or requires Astro. That boundary
is deliberate and load-bearing: it's what lets the same CMS back a Next.js site, a Flutter app,
or an Astro site without any of them getting special access.

## Astro as a first-class integration

Astro is not required, but it *is* officially supported, in the sense that this repo ships and
maintains a typed client for it: `@kenresoft-cms/astro` (`integrations/astro/`). Its entire purpose
is removing the need to hand-write `fetch()` calls and re-derive the public API's response
shape from scratch:

```ts
import { createKenresoftClient } from '@kenresoft-cms/astro';

const cms = createKenresoftClient({ url: 'http://localhost:8787' });

const posts = await cms.entries.list({ contentType: 'blog-post' });
const post = await cms.entries.get({ contentType: 'blog-post', slug: 'hello-world' });
```

Despite the package name, nothing in `integrations/astro/src/index.ts` is Astro-specific —
it's a plain, isomorphic `fetch` wrapper. It's positioned as *the* Astro integration because
Astro is this project's first-class frontend target (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2/§15), not
because the code needs Astro to run. Other frameworks are expected to call the public API
directly rather than through this package, at least for now (see Future work below).

### Why not `@kenresoft-cms/cms-sdk`, why not framework-generic?

An earlier draft of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §15 sketched a hypothetical `@kenresoft-cms/cms-sdk`.
This implementation uses `@kenresoft-cms/astro` instead, matching Astro's own convention for
official integrations (`@astrojs/<name>`-style naming) and keeping the scope honest: this
package was built for, and tested against, one framework. A framework-generic SDK is future
work, not a rename of this package (see Future work).

### What the client covers today

- `entries.list({ contentType })` — every published entry for a content type, by slug.
- `entries.get({ contentType, slug })` — one published entry, or `null` if it doesn't exist
  *or* isn't published (the public API doesn't distinguish those two cases — see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6/§14 — and neither does this client).
- `media.url({ id })` — the public URL for a Media item's file bytes (URL construction only,
  no fetch — use it directly as an `<img src>`). Backed by `GET /api/v1/public/media/:id/file`
  (`apps/api/src/routes/public/media.ts`), unauthenticated like the entry routes, edge-cached
  for a year via the same Cache API pattern as entries (`lib/public-cache.ts`) since media is
  immutable once uploaded — no edit endpoint, only create/delete — and invalidated on delete.
- `media.get({ id })` — `{ altText, contentType, width, height }` for a Media item, or `null`
  if it doesn't exist. Backed by `GET /api/v1/public/media/:id` (added after Public media
  serving shipped, closing the gap noted below in Known limitations' history) — everything an
  `<img>` needs beyond the src from `media.url()` above: a real `alt` and dimensions to reserve
  layout space before the file loads, instead of falling back to the entry's title.
- `forms.submit({ formSlug, data })` — submits a public form. Rate limited server-side
  (5/60s per client IP) and validated against that form's own field definitions — there's no
  client-side equivalent of those definitions to validate against here (no public
  form-metadata endpoint either), so a validation failure only surfaces after a real request.
- A `KenresoftApiError` thrown for any other non-2xx response from `entries.*`/`media.*`'s
  underlying fetch, carrying the HTTP status; for `forms.submit`, thrown for *any* non-2xx
  response (400/404/429 are all meaningful outcomes here, not something to paper over), with
  `issues` populated for a 400 (the field-level validation errors).

This covers the entire public API surface (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §8) — there's nothing else
public to wrap. The admin API (creating/editing content types, entries, media, users, forms)
is deliberately never exposed here; that boundary is the whole point of the CMS-first
architecture (§4/§9), not something this client works around.

There's deliberately no `contentTypes.list()`/`contentTypes.get()`. The public API has no
endpoint for content-type metadata (field definitions, etc.) — only `apps/admin`'s
authenticated admin API can see that. A content type is only ever addressed by its slug when
fetching entries, which the client already supports; there was nothing else to wrap.

## How Astro communicates with the CMS

```
Kenresoft CMS/API (wrangler dev, :8787)
        |
        |  GET /api/v1/public/:contentType
        |  GET /api/v1/public/:contentType/:slug
        |  GET /api/v1/public/media/:id/file
        v
@kenresoft-cms/astro  (integrations/astro)
        |
        v
   Astro site  (examples/astro-site)
        |
        v
     Browser
```

Astro never touches D1 or R2 directly, never sees an admin session token, and never imports
anything from `apps/api`'s internals. The public API is the entire interface.

## Local development

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the CMS
pnpm --filter @kenresoft-cms/api dev        # http://localhost:8787

# Terminal 2 — the Astro example
pnpm --filter kenresoft-cms-example-astro dev   # http://localhost:4321
```

(Or `pnpm dev` at the repo root, which starts every workspace app's dev server in parallel,
including both of the above.)

Both `integrations/astro` and `examples/astro-site` are ordinary pnpm workspace members
(`pnpm-workspace.yaml` lists `integrations/*` and `examples/*` alongside `apps/*`/`packages/*`)
— a plain `pnpm install` at the repo root wires `@kenresoft-cms/astro` into the example via a
workspace symlink, same as any other internal package. There is no separate install step and
no `--ignore-workspace` flag needed; an earlier version of this example was deliberately kept
outside the workspace to mimic an external consumer, but that made consuming
`@kenresoft-cms/astro` from it awkward for no real benefit — a real SDK's own example app living in
the SDK's own monorepo is a completely standard pattern.

## Environment variables

`examples/astro-site/.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

```
PUBLIC_KENRESOFT_CMS_URL=http://localhost:8787
```

The `PUBLIC_` prefix is Astro's convention for env vars that are safe to ship to the browser —
appropriate here since this is just the CMS's public API base URL, not a secret. Nothing in
this integration ever needs a server-only secret: the public API requires no authentication at
all, by design (§8/§9). If you ever add server-only configuration to an Astro site consuming
Kenresoft CMS (e.g. a *different* URL for admin-authenticated build tooling), give it a
non-`PUBLIC_`-prefixed name so Astro keeps it out of the client bundle.

## Static vs SSR

`examples/astro-site` uses server rendering (`astro.config.mjs`: `output: 'server'`, the
`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter). Every page fetches from the CMS **at request time**:

```
   Request
      ↓
 astro-site (SSR)
      ↓
CMS public API (its own edge cache — docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §12)
```

This means a published edit is visible on the very next request — no rebuild step. This
replaced an earlier static-output design (Astro's `getStaticPaths()`) specifically because
static output froze the blog's route list at build time: a brand-new post 404'd on the live
site until the next manual `astro build`, and an edit to an existing post's content likewise
didn't show until a rebuild. `blog/[slug].astro` fetches its entry per-request and 404s itself
when the slug doesn't resolve, rather than pre-generating a fixed list of paths.

Static output was the right choice for Phase 1's first vertical slice (the simplest reliable
strategy, matching `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §20.1's "Astro renders the post" framing) but stopped
being the right default once "does a new post actually appear" became something worth verifying
end-to-end. `@kenresoft-cms/astro`'s client has no build-time-only assumptions either way — it's
just `fetch`, equally callable from a static `getStaticPaths()` page or an SSR one — so this was
a config change in this example plus dropping `getStaticPaths()` from one page, not a redesign
of the CMS API or the client.

## Cloudflare compatibility (future)

The eventual production shape (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §15):

```
CLIENT CLOUDFLARE ACCOUNT
├── Kenresoft CMS
│   ├── Worker/API
│   ├── D1
│   └── R2
└── Astro Website
    └── Cloudflare deployment (Astro's official Cloudflare adapter)
```

The CMS and an Astro site consuming it are separate deployable applications, each with their
own Cloudflare deployment. A real CMS deployment now exists (`apps/api`'s `wrangler.toml` has
real D1/R2 resource ids, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`'s backup drill and the security-hardening
pass both ran against it), but a production Astro deployment alongside it — `apps/admin` has no
deployed home yet either — is still not provisioned or tested. Getting there is genuinely a
distinct next phase, not a small extension of this one.

## Known limitations

- **No public content-type metadata endpoint — by design, not a bug.** A generic Astro page
  can't discover a content type's field list at build/request time; it has to know the field
  names it expects in advance (as `examples/astro-site`'s pages do). Exposing field
  definitions publicly is a real product decision (it reveals internal content-modeling
  structure to anyone), not something to add unilaterally — flagged here as a decision point
  for whoever owns that call, not committed to either way.
- A rare, non-deterministic `astro build` exit-code flake was observed once during Phase 1
  verification on this Windows/Node 24 environment (`Assertion failed:
  !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)` from libuv, thrown *after* all pages had already
  generated correctly). Multiple immediate reruns succeeded cleanly with no errors. This
  reads as a native-addon/Node-version teardown race (esbuild/sharp), not anything wrong with
  the CMS integration or its output — but if `astro build` ever reports a non-zero exit here,
  check `dist/` before assuming the build actually failed.

## Future work

Not implemented, deliberately (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §20's phase boundaries and this
doc's Cloudflare compatibility section) — listed as open decisions, not commitments:

- **Public content-type metadata** — see Known limitations above; a decision point, not a gap
  being tracked toward a default "yes."
- A framework-generic SDK (`@kenresoft-cms/sdk` or similar) that `@kenresoft-cms/astro` could become a
  thin wrapper around, for Next.js/Vue/Flutter/etc. consumers — today those frameworks call the
  public API directly, which is a fully supported, first-class path (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  §4), just without a typed client yet.
- Production Cloudflare deployment of `examples/astro-site` (or a real Astro site) alongside a
  real Kenresoft CMS deployment.
