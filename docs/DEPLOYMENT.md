# Deploying your own instance

Kenresoft CMS is a reusable, open-source codebase. Not a hosted service. Deploying it means
provisioning your **own** Cloudflare account's resources and pointing your own fork at them
(`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §11, "Single Site Per Instance"). Nothing in this repository, including
its GitHub Actions workflows, deploys to Kenresoft's own Cloudflare account on your behalf:
every value that would need to be, is either configured per-deployment in files you edit after
forking, or supplied via secrets/variables that belong to your own GitHub repository, or (for
the API Worker) provisioned automatically the first time you deploy. See below.

## Three ways to deploy

- **One-click**: the button below clones this repo into your own GitHub account and deploys
  the API Worker (only, see "Two Workers, one install" below) through Cloudflare's own guided
  setup. **Verified with a real click-through**, not just reasoned about: it correctly deploys
  the API Worker end to end.
  [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/kenresoft-technologies/kenresoft-cms)
  `wrangler.toml` deliberately lives at the **repository root**, not inside `apps/api/` where
  the Worker's own source code is. The button only detects a config there, and a subdirectory
  URL makes Cloudflare treat that subdirectory as the *entire* contents of the new repo it
  creates, which would break `apps/api`'s `workspace:*` dependencies on
  `@kenresoft-cms/database`/`@kenresoft-cms/contracts` (this failed exactly this way, with Cloudflare
  reporting "No Wrangler configuration detected", before the config moved to the root, see
  `wrangler.toml`'s own top comment, and [`apps/api/README.md`](../apps/api/README.md) for the
  full explanation). There is no equivalent button for the Admin Worker. See
  [`apps/admin/README.md`](../apps/admin/README.md) for exactly why, confirmed empirically, not
  assumed.
- **Guided CLI**: clone the repo, then:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm run setup
  ```
  Runs `scripts/setup.mjs`. Every step below is an explicit action the script performs, not
  implicit "magic" (only wrangler's own D1/R2 auto-provisioning, used internally by a couple of
  these steps, is genuinely automatic on Cloudflare's side): checks you're logged in to
  `wrangler`, creates a D1 database and R2 bucket if you don't already have them configured,
  applies migrations, sets `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, deploys the API Worker, fixes up
  `BETTER_AUTH_URL` once the real deployed URL is known, then builds and deploys `apps/admin` as
  its own Worker too (see "Two Workers, one install" below) and wires its origin into
  `CORS_ORIGINS` for you. Idempotently: running `pnpm run setup` again never appends a
  duplicate origin, re-provisions an existing D1/R2, or otherwise redoes work that's already
  done. One command, both apps live. Recommended for anyone not deploying through CI.
- **Manual**: the full walkthrough below. Read this if you want to understand (or script)
  every step yourself, or the guided paths above don't fit your setup. Component-level detail
  (prerequisites, config, deploying just one piece) lives in each app's own README:
  [`apps/api/README.md`](../apps/api/README.md), [`apps/admin/README.md`](../apps/admin/README.md).

## Two Workers, one install

A full Kenresoft CMS installation is **two independent Cloudflare Workers**, not one:

- `apps/api`: the Hono API, D1, R2, auth, everything in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Config at the
  repository root (`wrangler.toml`; see that file's own comment for why it isn't inside
  `apps/api/`).
- `apps/admin`: the React/Vite dashboard, deployed as Workers **static assets**
  (`apps/admin/wrangler.toml`), not Cloudflare Pages. Cloudflare's own docs now steer new
  static-hosting projects toward Workers Static Assets instead (Pages carries a migration
  banner in Cloudflare's docs; the older Workers Sites mechanism is deprecated in favor of it),
  so this keeps both halves of the CMS on the same, currently-recommended primitive.

They stay two separate deploys/URLs/version histories on purpose, `apps/admin` only ever talks
to the API the way it always has, over its own public HTTPS URL via `VITE_API_URL` and `fetch()`
(`apps/admin/src/lib/api-client.ts`, `auth-client.ts`), the same as when you run it locally
against a remote API. Nothing about that integration changes; only *where* the admin app itself
runs does. The tradeoff this buys you: deploying or rolling back the admin app can never touch
the API's own deployment, and vice versa.

Because they're two different origins by default, the API's CORS allow-list (`CORS_ORIGINS`)
and its cookies (`sameSite: 'none', secure: true`, see `apps/api/src/lib/auth-options.ts`'s own
comment) already handle cross-origin sign-in; both guided paths above (button+CLI-finish, or
`pnpm run setup` alone) wire the admin's real deployed origin into `CORS_ORIGINS` for you. If you
own a custom domain, you can additionally put both Workers behind one hostname with a
[Route](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) per path
(`/api/*` to the API Worker, everything else to the admin Worker) for a single-origin experience
with no CORS at all. This is a deliberate later upgrade, not part of the default install, since
it needs a Cloudflare-managed zone the default `*.workers.dev` setup doesn't require.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account (the free tier covers Workers, D1, and R2 at this project's scale).
- [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) installed and logged in:
  `wrangler login`.
- `pnpm` installed (`corepack enable` or `npm install -g pnpm`).
- Node 20+.

## 2. Fork or clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenresoft-technologies/kenresoft-cms.git your-site-name
cd your-site-name
pnpm install
```

## 3. Provision your own Cloudflare resources

`wrangler.toml`'s `[[d1_databases]]`/`[[r2_buckets]]` bindings deliberately omit their
`database_id`/`bucket_name`. This triggers wrangler's own
[automatic provisioning](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):
the first plain `wrangler deploy` you run (step 6) creates a fresh D1 database and R2 bucket on
*your* account and writes their real ids back into `wrangler.toml` for you, non-interactively.
**You can skip straight to step 5** unless you want more control than that. A specific
`--location` hint, or resource names that don't match this repo's defaults:

```bash
wrangler d1 create kenresoft-cms-db --binding DB
wrangler r2 bucket create kenresoft-cms-media --binding MEDIA_BUCKET
```

Both commands print a `[[d1_databases]]`/`[[r2_buckets]]` snippet with the real `database_id`/
`bucket_name`. Copy those two values into the matching block in `wrangler.toml` yourself.
**Don't add `--update-config`**: it sounds like it should do that copy for you (and does, for a
`wrangler.jsonc`/`.json` config), but confirmed empirically against this repo's `wrangler.toml`
it silently does nothing to the file. No error, just the same manual-instructions snippet
either way. If you skip pasting the id in by hand after using this explicit path, your next
`wrangler deploy` sees `database_id` still missing and auto-provisions a *second* database (which
then fails outright for D1, since the name you already used is now taken).

Either way, the rate-limiting bindings (`[[ratelimits]]`) use arbitrary, account-unique
`namespace_id` values (`"1001"`, `"1002"`, `"1003"`). These are not provisioned resources, so
leave them as-is regardless.

## 4. CORS_ORIGINS and BETTER_AUTH_URL

Two `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml` you'll want to revisit once you have real URLs:

- `CORS_ORIGINS`: append your deployed admin app's real origin once you've deployed it (step 8).
  The committed default is just the local Vite dev server's ports.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: **can't be set correctly before your first deploy**. A Worker has no
  `*.workers.dev` URL until it exists. The committed placeholder
  (`https://REPLACE_AFTER_FIRST_DEPLOY.workers.dev`) is safe to deploy with as-is (it only
  affects redirect/callback URL construction, not cookie security, see the file's own comment).
  Deploy once (step 6), copy the real URL wrangler prints, paste it in here, then deploy again.
  `pnpm run setup` automates exactly this **once**. It only ever fills in `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
  while it's still this placeholder. Once it holds a real value (the auto-filled
  `*.workers.dev` URL, or a custom domain you've pointed here yourself), rerunning `pnpm run
  setup` never touches it again. To change it deliberately later. E.g. to move onto a custom
  domain. Use `pnpm run update -- --auth` instead (see "Updating configuration" below), which
  explains the consequences and asks for confirmation before changing anything.

## 5. Set secrets

```bash
cd apps/api
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET   # any long random string — never commit this
```

Local dev also needs `.dev.vars` (copy `.dev.vars.example`). It overrides both `[vars]` and
secrets during `wrangler dev`, so your local `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` can differ from the deployed
one.

If this is ever skipped or lost against a real deployment, the Worker no longer fails loudly on
its own the way you might expect. Better-auth's own "you are using the default secret" guard
only fires when `NODE_ENV=production`, which is never true in a Cloudflare Worker, so a missing
secret used to mean every session got silently signed with better-auth's publicly known default,
with no exception or log line anywhere until someone thought to check. The API Worker now checks
this itself and refuses to serve any session-touching request until a real secret is set. Check
`GET /api/v1/system/status`'s `authSecretConfigured` field (also shown on Settings → API) any
time you want to confirm this without Cloudflare CLI access at all.

## 6. Deploy, then run migrations

```bash
pnpm --filter @kenresoft-cms/api deploy
pnpm --filter @kenresoft-cms/database migrate:remote
```

Deploy first: if you skipped the explicit `wrangler d1 create` in step 3, this is what
auto-provisions your D1 database. Migrations need it to already exist, so this order matters
(reversing it fails with "database not found" the very first time, since nothing's created it
yet). Once the database exists at all, either order is fine on every deploy after this one.

A fresh deployment starts with no users. Ordinary sign-up can never claim the Owner role
(`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10 and its Changelog's "Secure first-owner bootstrap" entry). Create the
first Owner with a one-time bootstrap:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/api/v1/system/bootstrap/request
```

Then check this Worker's own logs (`wrangler tail`, or your `wrangler dev` terminal output) for a
line starting `[installation-bootstrap]` containing the token. It's never returned in the HTTP
response. Use it once, within 30 minutes:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/api/v1/system/bootstrap/complete \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"token":"<the token from your logs>","email":"you@example.com","password":"...","name":"Your Name"}'
```

Sign in normally from there. Both routes 404 outright once any user already exists on this
deployment.

## 7. Building your own frontend (not `examples/astro-site`)

The CMS backend (steps 1-6) is frontend-agnostic. Anything that can call an HTTP API can
consume it (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4). To start a real Astro frontend of your own:

```bash
npm create @kenresoft-cms@latest my-site -- --astro
```

This scaffolds a small, standalone Astro starter wired to the published `@kenresoft-cms/astro`
client (`npm install @kenresoft-cms/astro` also works directly in an existing project, see
`integrations/astro/README.md`). It's yours from that point on: deploy it however you like
(Cloudflare Pages, Workers Static Assets, or any other host) with whatever pipeline you choose:
nothing about it is CMS-managed.

**`examples/astro-site` is not that starter.** It's a large, illustrative reference
implementation in this repo. The thing that actually exercises every public API surface
end-to-end (blog, categories, media, forms, Commerce cart/checkout, Structured Settings, Site
Builder Pages/Blocks). Kept here to show real, working integration patterns, not to be forked,
built on top of, or deployed as your site. Read it for patterns; don't run it as production. If
you want to see it in action locally: `cd examples/astro-site && PUBLIC_KENRESOFT_CMS_URL=... pnpm dev`.
There is no supported deploy path or update mechanism for it, and none is planned. That's by
design, not an oversight.

## 8. The admin app

`apps/admin` deploys as its **own Worker** (`apps/admin/wrangler.toml`, static assets, not
Cloudflare Pages; see "Two Workers, one install" above), **after** step 6, `VITE_API_URL` is
baked into the build by Vite (build-time only, never runtime-configurable), so it needs your
API's real deployed URL to already exist:

```bash
cd apps/admin
VITE_API_URL=https://your-worker-url pnpm build
wrangler deploy
```

`pnpm build` also generates `dist/_headers` (Content-Security-Policy and other security headers,
scoped to the `VITE_API_URL` you just built with). See
[`apps/admin/README.md`](../apps/admin/README.md#9-workers-static-assets-configuration) for the
full detail and how it was verified. The first deploy also auto-provisions the Worker itself (its
name comes from `apps/admin/wrangler.toml`, no separate project-creation step needed, unlike
Pages). Then close the loop: add the resulting `https://your-cms-admin.<subdomain>.workers.dev`
origin to the
**root** `wrangler.toml`'s `CORS_ORIGINS` (step 4) and redeploy the API once more. Without
this, sign-in from the deployed admin app fails, since the API rejects cross-origin cookie auth
from an origin it doesn't recognize (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9). `pnpm run setup` automates this
entire sequence end to end, including the final redeploy.

## Commerce: configuring Paystack (optional)

Only relevant if you're using the `@kenresoft-cms/plugin-ecommerce` plugin, Commerce works fully
without this (catalog, orders, everything except actually taking payment) if you skip it entirely,
and payment initialization just responds "not configured" until you set it up.

Kenresoft Commerce takes payment through Paystack's **hosted checkout** only. Your Worker calls
Paystack's Initialize Transaction API, redirects the customer to a page Paystack hosts, and
Paystack redirects back to your own callback URL. There's no inline/popup JS widget anywhere in
this integration, which is why **no Paystack public key is ever needed or asked for**. A public
key exists specifically for client-side/inline widgets to authenticate with Paystack directly from
the browser, and this integration never puts Paystack's SDK in the browser at all.

The only credential involved is your Paystack **secret key**, and it's a Cloudflare Worker secret,
exactly like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`/`RESEND_API_KEY` above. Never a database value, never returned
by any API response, never logged.

```bash
# Local dev — add to apps/api/.dev.vars (see .dev.vars.example):
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_test_key_here

# Deployed environments:
wrangler secret put PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY
```

Use a key starting `sk_test_` while developing or testing, and one starting `sk_live_` for
production, Paystack itself decides sandbox-vs-live purely from which secret key you use, so
switching later is just setting a different secret, nothing in this codebase changes. The Commerce
Settings page in the admin (`/plugins/commerce/settings`) has a "Verify configuration" button that
confirms whether the key is set and which environment it's for, without ever displaying the key
itself. Useful for confirming a `wrangler secret put` actually took effect.

Register your webhook URL in the Paystack dashboard under **Settings → API Keys & Webhooks**, so
Paystack can notify your deployment when a payment completes even if the customer's browser never
makes it back to the callback page:

```
https://your-worker-url/api/plugins/commerce/public/v1/payments/webhook
```

(The Commerce Settings page shows this URL pre-filled with your actual deployed API origin, with a
copy button, you don't need to construct it by hand.) Paystack signs every webhook delivery with
the same secret key used above (there's no separate webhook-signing secret to configure), and this
deployment verifies that signature before ever acting on a delivery.

## Account verification, password recovery & owner recovery

Every email/password account must verify its email address before it can sign in at all
(`apps/api/src/lib/auth-options.ts`'s `requireEmailVerification`). Except the one account
created through the installation-bootstrap flow above (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10's Changelog),
since proving possession of the bootstrap token (itself only ever visible in this deployment's
own server logs) is already at least as strong a proof of legitimate access as an email round
trip. Every account created afterward (Add User, further signups) still needs the normal
verification step. Read on for how to verify one with zero email configuration.

Password reset and recovery codes degrade gracefully with no email configuration at all
(`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10.1), and the two owner-recovery mechanisms further below are entirely
opt-in.

**Verifying an account with no email configured**. If you haven't set up `EMAIL_PROVIDER` yet,
the verification email is still "sent," just logged instead of delivered (the noop sender,
below). Since you're the one who just deployed this Worker, you already have the Cloudflare
access needed to read that log:

```bash
wrangler tail          # a live deployment
# or just watch the terminal running `wrangler dev` for local development
```

Sign up (or use `Admin → Users → Add user`) then look for a logged line containing
`/verify-email?token=...`. It's already a complete URL pointing at your Admin app's own origin
(or `localhost` in local dev). Open it in your browser to verify and continue. The very first
account (created via the installation-bootstrap flow above) skips this step entirely. This
applies to every account after that. Once `EMAIL_PROVIDER` is configured (next section), every
account receives a real, clickable email instead.

**Password-reset and account-verification email**. Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER` in `wrangler.toml`'s
`[vars]` to enable actually sending these emails (it's unset by default, which logs instead of
sending, real accounts can still request a reset, and new accounts can still sign up, they just
don't receive anything until this is configured):

- **Cloudflare** (`EMAIL_PROVIDER = "cloudflare"`): add a `[[send_email]]` binding to
  `wrangler.toml`:
  ```toml
  [[send_email]]
  name = "EMAIL"
  ```
  then run `wrangler email sending enable` and follow its prompts to verify the domain you'll
  send from (`EMAIL_FROM`, also set in `[vars]`). No per-recipient verification is needed:
  only the sending domain.
- **Resend** (`EMAIL_PROVIDER = "resend"`): verify a sending domain in the
  [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com), set `EMAIL_FROM` to an address on it, and:
  ```bash
  wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
  ```

Either way, also set `ADMIN_URL` to your deployed `apps/admin` origin. It's what the
reset-password link *and* the verification link in these emails point to. Local dev doesn't
need this (it falls back to the first `CORS_ORIGINS` entry, your local Vite server).

**Break-glass owner recovery**. Disabled (404) until you explicitly opt in:

```bash
wrangler secret put OWNER_RECOVERY_SECRET   # a long random string; treat it like a master key
```

Once set, `POST /api/v1/system/recover-owner` with `{ secret, email, newPassword }` resets the
named owner's password. Keep this secret somewhere separate from your normal credentials (a
password manager, not a `.env` file that ends up in a screenshot). Anyone who has it can reset
the owner's password on this specific deployment. Leave it unset if you'd rather rely solely on
the CLI tool below, which needs no standing secret at all.

**Treat this as an extremely sensitive, ideally-temporary capability, not a permanent
convenience.** Unlike a compromised admin session or even a compromised admin password, this
secret bypasses the account entirely, no MFA, no re-authentication, no session to revoke, so
possessing it is equivalent to holding a permanent master key to this deployment for as long as
it stays set. Prefer setting it only when you actually anticipate needing it (or the moment
you're locked out and have Cloudflare account access to run `wrangler secret put`), and unset it
again once you've used it:

```bash
wrangler secret delete OWNER_RECOVERY_SECRET
```

If you do keep it set on an ongoing basis, rotate it periodically the same way you would any
other standing credential, and audit `audit_log` (`owner.recovered` entries) if you ever suspect
it leaked.

**CLI owner recovery**. For when you have real access to the deployment's Cloudflare account
(via `wrangler login` or an API token) but the owner can't sign in at all:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm recover-owner:remote           # or recover-owner:local for local dev
```

It looks up the owner account via `wrangler d1 execute`, prompts for a new password
interactively (never as a CLI argument, so it never lands in shell history), and signs that
account out everywhere. Pass `--email someone@example.com` if a deployment ever has more than
one owner, or `--env <name>` if your real D1 database lives under a named environment rather
than `wrangler.toml`'s top level (only relevant if you've set up a split like step 3's optional
explicit provisioning plus your own equivalent of `[env.production]`, most deployments don't
need this flag).

## Public API documentation (optional)

`GET /api/v1/openapi.json` and `GET /api/v1/docs` (a [Scalar](https://scalar.com) reference UI)
are unauthenticated and enabled by default. Useful for anyone building a frontend against your
deployment, and linked from Settings → API in the admin. They describe every route's request/
response *shape*, including authenticated admin and plugin routes. Never actual data, but still
more of your API's internal surface than some operators want exposed to anonymous requests.

To disable both (they 404 indistinguishably from not existing), add to `[vars]` in
`wrangler.toml`:

```toml
API_DOCS_ENABLED = "false"
```

## Automated deploys via GitHub Actions (optional)

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` can deploy the API Worker and the admin app on every push to
`main`, but is inert by default. Every job is gated on a repository variable, so forking this
repo never risks an accidental deploy attempt against secrets you haven't set. There is
deliberately no job for `examples/astro-site`. See step 7 above.

To enable it, in your fork's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

**Repository (or a `production` Environment's) secrets:**

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | A token scoped to exactly what deploying needs, Workers Scripts (Edit), D1 (Edit), Pages (Edit), Account (Read). Create one under **My Profile → API Tokens** rather than reusing a broad OAuth/global token. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | From `wrangler whoami`, or your Cloudflare dashboard URL. |

**Repository (or environment) variables:**

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DEPLOY_ENABLED` | `true`, the on/off switch every job checks. Leave unset (or anything else) to keep the workflow a no-op. |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Your deployed API's public URL, baked into the admin app build. |

Using a GitHub [Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)
named `production` (every deploy job already declares `environment: production`) lets you add
required reviewers or a wait timer on top of the `DEPLOY_ENABLED` gate. Recommended once this
is deploying somewhere real. The workflow also sets `concurrency: deploy-production` so two
deploys can never race each other.

None of this is required, `wrangler deploy` / `wrangler pages deploy` from your own machine or
CI provider is just as valid a way to ship changes.

## Updating an existing install

New CMS features and fixes are developed on the project's `develop` branch, then periodically
merged into `main`. The repository's default branch, and the one `pnpm run update`,
`npm create @kenresoft-cms@latest`, and the "Deploy to Cloudflare" buttons all pull from (each
follows GitHub's default branch automatically rather than a hardcoded name). `CHANGELOG.md`
tracks what actually changed, in plain terms, so you know what you're pulling in before you do.

From the repo root, run:

```bash
pnpm run update
```

That's the whole thing. It pulls the latest code from the `upstream` git remote (both a plain
`git clone` of this repo and one scaffolded via `npm create @kenresoft-cms@latest` have one
already), installs dependencies, applies any new database migrations, and redeploys both Workers.
Deliberately **not** `pnpm run setup` run again: unlike `setup`, bare `pnpm run update` never
touches your `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, email configuration, D1/R2, or CORS. It's
the safe subset for an install that already exists, and touches nothing this deployment's own
configuration already holds.

Right after a redeploy, the admin site's HTML shell may briefly reference a JS bundle hash from
*before* the deploy, Cloudflare's edge cache for a Workers Static Assets site doesn't invalidate
`index.html` instantly. This is expected and self-corrects within a few minutes with no action
needed; it does not mean the deploy failed (the correct, new assets are already live underneath
and load fine if requested directly).

`pnpm run setup` itself is also safe to re-run. On an existing install it detects that and shows
a status summary plus a menu (**Continue without changes** / **Update configuration** /
**Reconfigure everything** / **Cancel**) instead of blindly repeating first-install steps.
Nothing is changed unless you explicitly select it: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is only rotated after an
explicit confirmation (rotating it logs out every current user), `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is only ever
auto-filled while it's still the pre-deploy placeholder. Never once it holds a real value,
custom domain included. And email configuration is only touched if you pick "change" for it. See
"Updating configuration" below for the equivalent standalone commands.

By default `update` follows whatever GitHub reports as `upstream`'s actual default branch
(currently `develop`, the project's own working branch; `main` is reserved for release
promotion, see `CLAUDE.md`'s branch rules). Correct for a real install, which should always
track the currently-recommended stable line. A deployment used deliberately for *testing*
pre-release code. E.g. a staging install that wants to try `develop` before it's promoted to
`main`, or vice versa. Can override this per run:

```bash
pnpm run update -- --branch develop
pnpm run update -- --branch main
```

or set it once so every future `pnpm run update` in that checkout keeps using it without
repeating the flag:

```bash
export UPDATE_BRANCH=develop   # add to your shell profile, or a per-checkout .env you source
pnpm run update
```

An explicit `--branch` always wins over `UPDATE_BRANCH` if both are given. This only affects the
plain code-pull update. It's rejected if combined with `--auth`/`--email`/`--storage`/
`--database`, which never touch git at all.

If your install has no `upstream` remote at all (a raw zip download, or one deliberately
removed), `update` skips the code-pull step with a note and still redeploys whatever's on disk:
add the remote yourself to opt back in: `git remote add upstream
https://github.com/kenresoft-technologies/kenresoft-cms.git`. An install scaffolded before this
tool switched from a tarball download to a real `git clone` will hit a one-time prompt the first
time `update` pulls new code, since its local history has no real ancestry to merge against yet.
Confirming it is safe to proceed reconciles that once, and every update after is a normal,
low-friction merge. `wrangler.toml` is protected through this one-time merge specifically: it's
restored to exactly what this install had committed immediately beforehand, rather than left to
the merge's own `-X theirs` conflict resolution (which would otherwise silently replace your
real `database_id`/`bucket_name`/`BETTER_AUTH_URL`/custom-domain routes with the generic
template's placeholders, with no conflict marker to catch by eye, a real incident this behavior
exists to prevent). If you scripted this reconciliation by hand before this protection existed,
or if `wrangler.toml` still looks wrong afterward for any other reason, check `git log -p --
wrangler.toml` for the merge commit and restore your real values from the commit just before it.

`update` refuses to run (rather than silently doing the wrong thing) in two situations: if
`wrangler.toml` has no `database_id` at all. Meaning either `pnpm run setup` was never actually
run for this install (run it first), *or* an already-live install's `wrangler.toml` just had its
real values wiped by the reconciliation-merge bug described above (recover from git history
instead of running `setup`, which would provision brand-new resources rather than recovering the
old ones); and if the Worker it's about to redeploy is currently bound to a *different* D1
database than this install's own `wrangler.toml` expects, meaning it belongs to a different
deployment (every fork of this template ships the same default Worker name, so one Cloudflare
account running more than one deployment of it can collide), `wrangler deploy` has no "already
exists" safeguard the way provisioning D1/R2 does, so without this check a redeploy would
silently overwrite the other deployment's live Worker. If you hit the second case, run
`pnpm run setup` again instead: it detects the same collision interactively and picks a new,
unique name for both Workers (pairing the admin Worker's rename to the API Worker's) rather than

## Updating configuration

Changing one specific piece of this deployment's configuration. The Better Auth URL, email
provider, or reviewing storage/database status. Without touching code, secrets you didn't ask
about, or anything else:

```bash
pnpm run update -- --auth       # Better Auth URL
pnpm run update -- --email      # Resend / Cloudflare Email
pnpm run update -- --storage    # R2 bucket — status only, see below
pnpm run update -- --database   # D1 database — status only, see below
pnpm run update -- --domain          # Custom domain / workers.dev (API Worker) — see below
pnpm run update -- --admin-domain    # Custom domain / workers.dev (Admin Worker) — see below
```

Each shows the current value first (secrets are always reported as "configured"/"not
configured", never their actual value), then a Keep/Change/Cancel-style menu. Nothing is written
unless you explicitly choose to change it, and only the one field the command names is ever
touched. This is the fix for two things real deployments have hit before this command existed:

- **`BETTER_AUTH_URL` being silently reset by `pnpm run setup`.** It used to overwrite this on
  every run, including a rerun after you'd pointed it at a custom domain. Because the script had
  no way to tell "the pre-deploy placeholder, safe to fill in" apart from "a real value someone
  set on purpose." `setup` now only ever fills it in while it's still the placeholder; use
  `pnpm run update -- --auth` for every change after that. Changing it warns first. It affects
  existing sessions, trusted origins/CORS, and any OAuth callback registered against the old
  value.
- **Skipping Resend's API-key prompt silently clearing an already-configured key.** Re-running
  the old email setup and pressing Enter at the API-key prompt (thinking "it's already set, I
  don't need to re-paste it") wrote an *empty* secret, which reads as unconfigured everywhere the
  app checks it, `pnpm run update -- --email`'s API-key prompt now explicitly means "leave
  blank to keep the existing key," and never writes an empty value.

`--storage`/`--database` are deliberately status-only: repointing either binding at a different
D1 database or R2 bucket moves no data, so there's no safe default action to automate. They print
the current name/id and explain the manual `wrangler.toml` edit if you genuinely mean to do that.

`--domain` connects a custom domain (e.g. `api.example.com`) to the API Worker without a single
dashboard click: it writes a `[[routes]]` entry with `custom_domain = true` and redeploys:
Cloudflare creates the DNS record and route for you on that deploy, as long as the domain's zone
is already on this Cloudflare account. It then separately, and only if you explicitly confirm,
offers to disable the `*.workers.dev` fallback URL. Connect and verify the custom domain first,
then come back and disable the fallback once you're sure it's working; this command never
disables it without asking. After connecting a domain, run `pnpm run update -- --auth` to point
`BETTER_AUTH_URL` at it and rebuild the admin app against the new address. The admin app's own
build target doesn't change just because a route was added.

`--admin-domain` does the same thing for the Admin Worker's own, completely separate
`wrangler.toml` (`apps/admin/wrangler.toml`). And additionally refreshes the `ADMIN_URL` secret
(the address every password-reset/verification email links to) to match, since nothing else does
that automatically. Confirmed as a real, live gap: connecting a custom domain to the admin app
without this command left every email pointing at its original `*.workers.dev` URL indefinitely.

**Non-interactive / CI use**. Add `--ci` and set the corresponding `*_NEW` environment
variable(s); an **omitted** variable always means "leave unchanged," never "clear" or reset to a
default, matching the interactive commands' own behavior:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL_NEW=https://cms.example.com pnpm run update -- --auth --ci
EMAIL_PROVIDER_NEW=resend EMAIL_FROM_NEW=noreply@example.com RESEND_API_KEY_NEW=re_... \
  pnpm run update -- --email --ci
CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NEW=api.example.com DISABLE_WORKERS_DEV=true pnpm run update -- --domain --ci
ADMIN_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NEW=cms.example.com pnpm run update -- --admin-domain --ci
```

Only one category may be targeted per invocation. Run the command again for a second category
rather than combining flags, so each change's own confirmation/warning is easy to reason about in
isolation (and, in CI, easy to audit from the job log).

## Renaming a Worker (changing its `*.workers.dev` URL)

Cloudflare has no in-place Worker rename. Changing `wrangler.toml`'s `name` and redeploying
creates a **new** Worker at the new URL; the old one keeps running, unmodified, at its old URL
until you delete it. Renaming also cascades: the API Worker's URL is baked into the admin app's
build (`VITE_API_URL`) and stored in `BETTER_AUTH_URL`; the admin Worker's URL is stored in the
API's `CORS_ORIGINS` allow-list and `ADMIN_URL` (used to build password-reset email links).
`pnpm run rename-worker` handles all of that for you:

```bash
pnpm run rename-worker -- --target api --name my-new-api-name
pnpm run rename-worker -- --target admin --name my-new-admin-name
```

It checks the new name isn't already taken by an unrelated Worker in your account first (same
`checkWorkerOwnership()` check `update`/`setup` use above), asks you to confirm before doing
anything, deploys the new Worker and updates every cross-reference, then asks whether to delete
the now-unused old Worker. Left in place by default if you say no, deletable later yourself with
`wrangler delete <old-name>`.

## Backups and recovery

**D1 also has a free, automatic, zero-setup safety net independent of anything below**:
Cloudflare's [Time Travel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/time-travel/) retains a
30-day point-in-time-recoverable history of every D1 database with nothing to configure or
remember to run, `wrangler d1 time-travel restore your-cms-db --timestamp=...` restores to any
minute within that window. It's not a substitute for an off-platform export (Time Travel can't
help if Cloudflare itself has an incident, and 30 days is a hard limit), which is what the manual
export below is for, but it means an accidental bad migration or a slip of `DELETE` is recoverable
immediately, at no cost, even if you've never run a manual backup at all. R2 has no equivalent
built-in versioning (confirmed, it's a standing feature request, not shipped), which is exactly
why `backup-media.mjs` below matters more for media than the D1 export does for content.

**D1** (content types, entries, forms, users, settings, media *metadata*): export and restore
both work, verified end-to-end against a real deployment:

```bash
wrangler d1 export your-cms-db --remote --output backup.sql
```

This briefly makes the database unavailable to serve queries while the export runs (a few
seconds at this project's data volume). Plan around that if you automate it. Restoring is the
same file, applied with `wrangler d1 execute your-cms-db --remote --file backup.sql`, or loaded
into any local SQLite tool (`sqlite3 test.db < backup.sql`) to inspect or verify a backup
without touching the live database, which is how this exact export/restore path was verified
while writing this doc.

There's no built-in scheduling for this. Run it by hand, or put the export command on a cron
somewhere you control (it's a normal `wrangler` CLI call, nothing D1-specific about scheduling
it).

**R2** (media file bytes, D1 only stores each file's metadata and its R2 key, never the
binary, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9/§14): there's no single-command bucket export in R2/wrangler,
so `apps/api/scripts/backup-media.mjs` walks the `media` table (the one source of truth for
which R2 keys exist) and downloads/uploads each object individually via `wrangler r2 object
get`/`put`. The same "shell out to wrangler, no driver of its own" approach
`recover-owner.mjs` uses for D1:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm backup-media -- --remote --out ./media-backup     # or --local for local dev
pnpm restore-media -- --remote --from ./media-backup
```

Pass `--env <name>` too if your real R2 bucket lives under a named environment rather than
`wrangler.toml`'s top level (same caveat as CLI owner recovery above). Also check the script's
own `BUCKET_NAME` constant matches your actual bucket. It's only reliably
`"kenresoft-cms-media"` if you used step 3's explicit `wrangler r2 bucket create`, not if you
left the bucket name to automatic provisioning (which generates its own name).

A backup is a plain directory: `manifest.json` (every media row's metadata) plus an `objects/`
tree mirroring each file's own R2 key. Restoring only repopulates R2. Run it alongside
restoring the corresponding D1 backup above, since D1's `media` table is what makes those R2
keys discoverable by the app at all; restoring one without the other leaves either orphaned
files with no metadata pointing at them, or metadata pointing at files that don't exist.
Verified end-to-end against a real local deployment (backup, then restore the same objects back
over themselves, then confirmed the bytes were unchanged) the same way the D1 drill above was.

If you'd rather mirror the whole bucket continuously instead of running point-in-time backups,
R2 is also S3-API-compatible, so an S3-aware sync tool (e.g. `rclone`) pointed at your bucket's
S3 endpoint (Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → your bucket → Settings) works too.
