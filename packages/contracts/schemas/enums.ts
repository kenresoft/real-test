// from here rather than declaring it locally. Splitting this out isn't just organizational: a
// domain file that both defines an enum AND builds zod schemas from it can't be safely
// tree-shaken by Rollup — z.object(...) call expressions are opaque, non-provably-pure
// function calls, so importing just the enum from such a file still pulls the whole module
// (zod included) into whatever bundle imports it. Confirmed empirically once during the
// packages/contracts + @hono/zod-openapi migration: apps/admin's production bundle contained
// ZodError/ZodObject/ZodType even though its own code only ever did `export type` re-exports —
// the leak came from re-exporting FIELD_TYPES etc. out of files that also called z.object(...)
// at module scope. This file exists so that never happens again.
